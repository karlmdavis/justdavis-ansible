# Postfix on Debian is not properly configured to run `saslauthd`: the `smtpd`
# service is (by default) run inside a chroot environment at 
# `/var/spool/postfix/`, which doesn't have access to the SASL socket file.
#
# This config adds that file (and friends) back into the chroot environment
# using a mount bind. This fix is taken from here: 
# <https://github.com/webmin/webmin/issues/58>, which is the only halfway 
# decent solution to this problem I managed to come across.
