# Note on Test Domains: The test variations below will actually be resolved 
# (and so must exist) during tests. At a minimum, this is required for Let's
# Encrypt to generate certs, but is likely required by a bunch of other 
# services being tested. The top-level test domains (e.g. 
# `tests.justdavis.com`) are managed via Route 53, so that the tests can 
# *actually manage* them. It's all kinda' complicated, but works.
