# This server has the following network interfaces:
#
# * eth0 & eth1: Not actually available (I think they're firewire or somesuch).
# * eth2: The lowest port builtin to the motherboard.
# * eth3: The middle port builtin to the motherboard.
# * eth4: A temporary PCIe replacement NIC. (eth2 and eth3 were disabled during a 2018-08-18 lightning storm.)
# * (unnamed): The top port builtin to the motherboard is for the board's Management Engine.
