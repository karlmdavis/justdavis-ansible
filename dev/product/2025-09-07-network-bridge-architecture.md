# Network Bridge Architecture Epic

**Date:** 2025-09-07

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Standardize `eddings` networking on Linux bridges for consistent VM communication.


## Project Overview

Migrate `eddings` server networking from mixed macvtap/direct interface architecture
  to a unified Linux bridge-based approach.
This change eliminates host-VM communication barriers and establishes a consistent,
  scalable networking foundation for current and future virtualization needs.


## Goals & Requirements

### Primary Goals

1. **Enable full host-VM communication** by eliminating macvtap isolation barriers.
   - Critical for SSH and RDP access to VMs when connecting via `eddings` as VPN gateway.
   - Required for Ansible management of VMs from `eddings` host.

2. **Establish consistent networking architecture** across all `eddings` interfaces.
   - WAN interface already uses bridge (br0), extend pattern to LAN interface.
   - Simplify mental model and troubleshooting procedures.

3. **Improve operational management and troubleshooting**.
   - Standard bridge tools (`brctl`, `ip bridge`) for all interfaces.
   - Consistent configuration patterns across network interfaces.
   - Better visibility into traffic flows and connectivity issues.

4. **Future-proof for additional VMs and networking requirements**.
   - Support multiple VMs without communication restrictions.
   - Enable advanced networking features (VLANs, trunking) if needed.
   - Maintain flexibility for evolving homelab requirements.

### Key Requirements

- **Zero functional regression**: All existing services must continue operating.
- **Minimal performance impact**: No noticeable degradation in network performance.
- **Reliable migration path**: Safe deployment with rollback capability.
- **Consistent naming**: Use descriptive bridge names (`br-wan`, `br-lan`).


## Current State Analysis

### Existing Configuration

**WAN Interface (eno1):**

- Already bridged as `br0`.
- Hosts public IP addresses (`96.86.32.137`, `96.86.32.139`).
- Works well for public-facing services.

**LAN Interface (enp4s0):**

- Direct DHCP configuration (`10.0.0.2`).
- VMs use macvtap with `source_mode=bridge`.
- **Problem**: Macvtap blocks host-VM communication by design.

### Communication Barriers

The macvtap configuration creates an isolation layer that prevents:

- SSH access to krout VM (`10.0.0.5`) from `eddings` host.
- RDP connectivity for GUI development workflow.
- Ansible management of VMs from the host system.
- Direct troubleshooting and monitoring of VM services.

This becomes critical when accessing the homelab remotely via `eddings` as VPN gateway,
  where the communication path must traverse the `eddings` host.


## Implementation Architecture

### Deployed Configuration

**WAN Bridge (`br-wan`):**

- Bridges the `eno1` interface (renamed from legacy `br0`).
- Maintains public IP configuration without changes.
- Preserves all WAN connectivity functionality.

**LAN Bridge (`br-lan`):**
- Bridges the `enp4s0` interface with DHCP client configuration.
- VMs attach directly to bridge interface (macvtap eliminated).
- Full bidirectional host-VM communication enabled.

### Advantages of Bridge Architecture

**Technical Benefits:**

- **Direct Host-VM Communication**: Complete elimination of macvtap isolation barriers.
- **Standard Linux Networking**: Leverages well-established kernel bridge implementation.
- **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Consistent tools and procedures across all interfaces.
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Comprehensive network monitoring and debugging capabilities.

**Operational Benefits:**

- **Ansible Compatibility**: Full VM management capability from `eddings` host.
- **Reliable Remote Access**: SSH/RDP functions consistently via VPN connections.
- **Scalability**: Additional VMs supported without architectural modifications.
- **Unified Management**: Single configuration and management approach across interfaces.


## Impact Assessment

### Performance Considerations

**Expected Impact:** Negligible performance overhead.

- Modern Linux bridges operate at near line-rate speeds.
- Typical overhead: <1ms latency, no throughput reduction.
- Home network usage patterns won't approach interface limits.
- VM workloads are development-focused, not performance-critical.

### Security Model

**Network Isolation:** Maintains appropriate security boundaries.

- VMs communicate at Layer 2 (equivalent to physical switch).
- No additional attack surface introduced by bridges.
- Standard enterprise virtualization security model.
- Broadcast domain limited to home network (minimal broadcast traffic).

### Reliability Assessment

**Stability:** Improved reliability over macvtap.

- Linux bridges: 20+ years of production use, battle-tested.
- Simpler networking path reduces potential failure points.
- Better integration with standard networking tools and monitoring.
- Consistent behavior patterns across both WAN and LAN interfaces.

## Implementation Details

### Netplan Configuration

The bridge architecture is implemented via netplan configuration in
`roles/eddings_networking/files/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`:

**WAN Bridge Implementation:**
- `br-wan` bridge interfaces the `eno1` physical interface
- Maintains existing public IP configuration
- Preserves all public service connectivity

**LAN Bridge Implementation:**
- `br-lan` bridge interfaces the `enp4s0` physical interface  
- DHCP client configuration maintains dynamic IP assignment
- Direct VM attachment without macvtap isolation layer

### Integration Benefits

This architecture change directly enables the **GUI Development VM Product**
  by removing the primary technical barrier to remote desktop access.
The bridge standardization creates a robust foundation
  for future homelab expansion while solving current operational requirements.

### Strategic Value

The implementation represents a successful transition from mixed networking approaches
  to a consistent, enterprise-standard architecture that serves as the
  foundation for current and future virtualization and networking needs.

## Potential Future Enhancements

- **VLAN Support**: Advanced network segmentation capabilities if needed
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Enhanced network monitoring and analytics
- **QoS Implementation**: Traffic prioritization for critical services
- **Additional Bridges**: Support for additional network segments
